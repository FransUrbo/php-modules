Thomas Jacob
	* For reimplementing (albeight with my old code w/ changes).
	* Removing the need for the environment variable CHARSET.
	* Misc buffer size (memory leak) fixes.
	* Slight rewrite of idn_idna_to_ascii() and idn_unicode_to_ascii()
	  - Shortened by usage of other LibIDN functions.
	* Make sure PHP-IDN return PHP warnings instead of errors when
	  something bad happens (application must deal with warning manually).
	* Adding TLD check from newer LibIDN (>0.4.0).
