PHP IDN 1.0 - Wed May 26 2004
	- Support TLD checking (patch by Thomas Jacob - see THANX_TO).
	  Functions:	tld_check_8z()
			tld_get()
			tld_get_table()
	- Show version of LibIDN and configuration values
	  when dumping info.
	- Lots of small bugfixes that solves the memory problem
	  by Thomas Jacob (see THANX_TO).
	  + Remove idn_charset(). Don't longer support the
	    CHARSET environment variable. Include this value
	    as a parameter to functions instead.
	  + Using wrong variables in stringprep_profile().
	    I used the output variable when the tempstring
	    was to be used!
	  + malloc() memory before using the output variable
	    (where we're putting the end result).
	  + Reimplementation of idn_to_unicode()
	- More dynamic build environment. Better support for
	  both Debian GNU/Linux stable as well as unstable.
	- Cleanup and rewrite of example PHP page
	  (the 'show {code,versions,functions}' stuff).
